  [**Create the Executable**]:
  Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run PyInstaller with the --onefile and --windowed options:
  ~~~
  pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py

  **--onefile**: Bundles everything into a single executable file.
  
  **--windowed**: Creates a windowed application without a terminal window. Use --console if it's a console application.
  Once that is done, and Build is completed. Go to or 'cd' to your dist folder and you may run the main.app. (you may need to chmod[give permission to execute the app or sh)
